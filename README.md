# IoT
Cam and Jeff's IoT code
The board and UNO should have these wires in these pins

Pin 11 (Arduino) -----> Echo

Pin 12 (Arduino) ------> Trig

GND (Arduino) -------> GND (Sensor)

5V (Arduino) -----> VCC (Sensor)

To make function the best, have the Arudino set in an ample position pointed at your door or in front of your desk.
Run the Ardunio code without opening the Serial Monitor. Then run the python code and input your game of choice (A test may be require to make sure you are shutting down the right program). Than slack off to your hearts content.
